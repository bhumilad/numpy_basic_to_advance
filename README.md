numpy is library of python programming.
we can create array , multidimension array , matrix and etc.

## for imstall ##
```
python=

pip install numpy

or
#if you use anaconda
then you don't need to download.numpy is inbuilt in conda
```

## you think we have create all this things using simple python then why we'll use numpy ? ##

so , numpy is too fast .it have lots of function . so we can esaily use in data science and machine learning.
